# Flashcard Website App

## Problem
I made this site because my girlfriend needs a flashcard system that's free because she doesn't like Quizlet. To help her with her schooling, I decided to make this site so she can study without the use of Quizlet.

## Goals
My goal for this app is to give the user the ability to create and study flashcard decks. You can name the decks which will basically be like a stack of index cards. Each index card can be given their own term and definition to mimick the front and back of a real index card.

## Functionality
The site gives you the ability to create what's called a "deck" of flash cards for later review. You do this by clicking the 'Create' option in the nav bar, then press the yellow button which will automatically scroll you to the deck options. Required fields are 
* Deck Name
* Deck Description (optional)
* At least 1 Flash card title and definition

The decks that you create are saved in LocalStorage for now but this means the decks won't pertain accross devices but will be saved to your device browser. I plan to add User Authentication later so each deck is saved to your account but for now, local storage works! You also have the ability to review decks by clicking 'Review' in your nav bar and from here you can update your deck name and description as well as delete the deck. If you click on the deck, it will send you to a new page where the deck info is displayed along with the cards. All you need to do is click one of the cards and it will show the other side! So far, that is all the functionality!

## Future Plans
This project has grabbed more interest than I expected. Originally started to help my girlfriend study, I have plans to make the site better for sure! Firstly, mobile responsiveness which shouldn't take long at all. Second, user authentication so the info persists accross devices is going to be a huge focus of mine. Third, Adding much better styling and making the site ✨beautiful✨ is going to be a big focus. You can already see the basic styling which isn't too bad as it is but I am an over achiever; Meaning, this site will be beautiful in the end. Later, I definitely plan on adding other ways to study such as: matching title to definition, filling in blanks, and an overall better flashcard experience. 

If you have any ideas, I would love to hear them so feel free to create a new issue or even contribute to this project!
