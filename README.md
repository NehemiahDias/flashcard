# Flashcard Website App

## Problem
I made this site because my girlfriend needs a flashcard system that's free because she doesn't like Quizlet. To help her with her schooling, I decided to make this site so she can study without the use of Quizlet.

## Goals
My goal for this app is to give the user the ability to create and study flashcard decks. You can name the decks which will basically be like a stack of index cards. Each index card can be given their own term and definition to mimick the front and back of a real index card.
